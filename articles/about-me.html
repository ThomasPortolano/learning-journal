                <h1 class="title">Hi there! My name is Thomas and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
                <div class="summary">After many years working in product (brand and agency), in diverse positions, I finally decided to get my coding skills to the next level.</div>

                <h2 class="section-title">Who I am</h2>
                <p>I am a french guy living in China. I have spent most of my professional career in Asia (mostly in Shanghai and Hong Kong). I started as a founder of an ecommerce company. While the project was fun, I got frustrated by my limited technical skills.</p>
                <p>6 years later, I joined an agency based in Shanghai, Wiredcraft, a very solid digital product agency and I had the best years of learning in my life there. After a few years, I joined Christie's, the top auction house, in the art world, as Head of Digital for Asia Pacific.</p>
                <p>This fantastic opportunity give the chance to work with amazing people everyday. I manage a team of developers, product managers and business analysts. On top of that, I have the chance to experience fantastic art works and work with colleagues from all over the world.</p>
                <p>To be a more creative and precise professional, I have to work not only on my soft skills (as a manager) but also on my hard skills. I love coding, keeping my hands dirty and building products.</p>
                <h2 class="section-title">How I am going to use this website</h2>
                <p>I am currently following the Front Developer path on Scrimba, which allowed me to learn a lot already. Along this journey, I intend to present my projects on this portfolio.</p>
                <p>I came accross an interesting article recommending devs to keep a work log. I found the idea interesting: it is project centric, so it's not focused on me (or some empty thoughts) and would help me to reflect my progress and what I need to learn.</p>
                <p>In short, I will present my projects as a junior developer, my key learnings and objectives for each project, this with the objectives in mind to be a better leader, solve real life problems and master the art to build my own projects</p>
