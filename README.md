# My Learning Journal

In this project, I am working on responsive design for a potential blog. 
The goal is to design and implement my CSS, starting with mobile design first, then expending the code to larger screens using Media Queries.

Responsive design is implementing using relative units and flex. I might try to develop a 2nd version using grid layout (still hugely hypothetical).

What's left to build in this project:
- ~~Article template~~
- ~~About me template~~
- ~~The whole set of larger screen templates (home, article, about me)~~
- ~~Replacing hard coded articles by articles stored in a separate data.js, to store articles content.~~
- ~~Creating a logic to handle different rendering if the article is "featured" or if it is a "sub-article"~~
- Adding clickable articles
- Blog template should be populated by content from a data repo (this including link to articles, pictures, and different paragraphs)
- CSS widget would be helpful to present code
- And more!

Happy Coding!
